## ECON OVERHAUL MOD

### When you research Currency your Merchants gain the ability to create a currency.

	10. Via Romana: All roads cost double upkeep and all city connections provide double gold.

### Currency Mechanics
	Currencies compete much like religions, however they don't spread like religions from city to city. I was thinking of several metrics that determine currency strength while also providing benefits.
	1. Inflation: increases every time a player purchases anything in a city. Has a passive decrease applied that can be boosted through currency enhancements
	2. Purchasing Power: influences prices of anything bought in cities (so high power equates to % off units/buildings) relies on factors such as GPT, inflation rate, trade route strength (ie balance of trade)
	3. Exchange rates: Purchasing power parity can create a comparison system that allows a visual representation of the best global economies

Additionally, the economics overview screen indicated currency strength movement ie changes in exchange rates from turn to turn.

	-This allows you to set the monetary policy for your civilization which is an enhancement to your currency.

	3. Protectionism: Untraded Luxury resources provide +1 Gold, +1 Happiness even if not Unique (OP?). Trade routes other players make to this city will generate an -1 Gold for the city owner and the trade route owner.
	4. Marxism: -1 Gold, +1 Production from all luxury resources. +1 Happiness in cities where production yields are higher than gold yields.  
	5. Colonialism: something about warring city states
	6. Keynesian: Spend 100 gold to increase GPT by some %? (interesting-HE)
	7. Leninism: involves military purchases and production increases
	8. Monetarism: 20% less inflation from purchases in cities
	9. National Socialism: something militarily interesting
